# Microfuzz

## About

This package is a copy of @nozbe/microfuzz, available at [https://github.com/Nozbe/microfuzz](https://github.com/Nozbe/microfuzz).
I brought a local copy to implement the CommonJS and ES modules fix that's been [accepted but not pushed to NPM](https://github.com/Nozbe/microfuzz/pull/6).

This version of microfuzz is from commit hash `8a4c6997d5754c6fb57be76ca9602cd622a22cef`, which has an MIT license attached.
That license is copied here and only applies to this directory and its children.
